ü§î The Problem: Why Do Customers Leave?
For any online retailer, customer acquisition is expensive. The real challenge lies in customer retention. This project tackles a critical business question: Can we identify customers who are about to leave before they do? Relying on guesswork leads to wasted marketing budget and lost revenue. We need a way to pinpoint at-risk customers and understand our most loyal ones to act effectively.

‚ú® Our Solution: A Proactive Strategy
This project moves beyond simple sales reporting to build a proactive retention engine. By analyzing over a year of transactional data, we developed a system that:

Segments customers into meaningful groups based on their purchasing behavior.

Predicts churn risk using a machine learning model.

Provides clear, actionable recommendations through an interactive dashboard designed for business decision-makers.

üó∫Ô∏è Our Process: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights
Our workflow was structured to ensure a robust and meaningful outcome.

Data Cleaning & Preparation: The initial dataset was noisy. We handled missing values, removed return transactions, and structured the data for analysis.

RFM Feature Engineering: We created a customer DNA using RFM scores:

R (Recency): How recent was their last purchase?

F (Frequency): How often do they buy?

M (Monetary): How much do they spend?

Unsupervised Clustering: Using K-Means, we let the data speak for itself, revealing 4 distinct customer personas.

Predictive Modeling: We trained a Random Forest model to predict which customers were likely to churn, allowing the business to intervene preemptively.

üë• Customer Personas Uncovered
Our analysis identified four key customer segments, each with its own unique characteristics and required strategy.

Persona

Key Characteristics

Recommended Action

üèÜ Champions

Your most valuable and loyal customers. They buy often and spend the most.

Reward them. Offer exclusive access, loyalty points, and personalized engagement.

‚≠ê Potential Loyalists

Consistent customers who show potential to become Champions.

Nurture them. Use targeted marketing and cross-selling to increase their frequency and spend.

üå± Newcomers

First-time or very recent buyers. The crucial first impression phase.

Onboard them. Provide a great initial experience and incentives for a second purchase.

‚ö†Ô∏è At-Risk

Customers who haven't purchased in a long time. High risk of leaving.

Re-engage them. Launch targeted "we miss you" campaigns with compelling offers to win them back.
