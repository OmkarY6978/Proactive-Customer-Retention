### ü§î The Challenge: Why Do Customers Leave?

For any online retailer, acquiring new customers is expensive. The real challenge lies in **customer retention**. This project tackles a critical business question: Can we identify customers who are about to leave *before* they do? Relying on guesswork leads to wasted marketing budgets and lost revenue. We need a way to pinpoint at-risk customers and understand our most loyal ones to act effectively.

### ‚ú® Our Approach: A Proactive Strategy

This project moves beyond simple sales reporting to build a proactive retention engine. By analyzing over a year of transactional data, we developed a system that:

1.  **Segments customers** into meaningful groups based on their purchasing behavior.
2.  **Predicts churn risk** using a machine learning model.
3.  **Provides clear, actionable recommendations** through an interactive dashboard designed for business decision-makers.

### üó∫Ô∏è Our Process: From Raw Data to Actionable Insights

Our workflow was structured to ensure a robust and meaningful outcome.

1.  **Data Cleaning & Preparation**: The initial dataset was noisy. We handled missing values, removed return transactions, and structured the data for analysis.
2.  **RFM Feature Engineering**: We created a customer "DNA" using RFM scores:
    - **R (Recency)**: How recent was their last purchase?
    - **F (Frequency)**: How often do they buy?
    - **M (Monetary)**: How much do they spend?
3.  **Unsupervised Clustering**: Using K-Means, we let the data speak for itself, revealing 4 distinct customer personas.
4.  **Predictive Modeling**: We trained a Random Forest model to predict which customers were likely to churn, allowing the business to intervene preemptively.

### üë• Customer Personas Uncovered

Our analysis identified four key customer segments, each with its own unique characteristics and required strategy.

| Persona                 | Key Characteristics                                    | Recommended Action                                                              |
| :---------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| üèÜ **Champions** | Your most valuable and loyal customers. They buy often and spend the most. | **Reward them.** Offer exclusive access, loyalty points, and personalized engagement. |
| ‚≠ê **Potential Loyalists**| Consistent customers who show potential to become Champions. | **Nurture them.** Use targeted marketing and cross-selling to increase their frequency and spend. |
| üå± **Newcomers** | First-time or very recent buyers. The crucial first impression phase. | **Onboard them.** Provide a great initial experience and incentives for a second purchase. |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **At-Risk** | Customers who haven't purchased in a long time. High risk of leaving. | **Re-engage them.** Launch targeted "we miss you" campaigns with compelling offers to win them back. |
